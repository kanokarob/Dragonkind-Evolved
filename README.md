# End Battle Reborn
Dragonkind Evolved builds upon the vanilla Ender Dragon fight. Rather than recreate the battle from scratch, it adds additional features and mechanics to increase difficulty and complexity while holding true to the general gameplay loop introduced by Vanilla.

Additionally, it incentivizes and rewards respawning the Ender Dragon. While the initial Ender Dragon fight does include changes, each successive battle will feature new Dragon types and End Crystal mechanics, both of which will continue to scale in difficulty as you slay more and more Ender Dragons.

## Ender Dragons
All Ender Dragons have more health than normal, and will have even more health depending on how many times it has been respawned. This corresponds to its difficulty level (Fledgeling, Powerful, Cruel, Immortal,Ferocious).

Whenever an Ender Dragon is respawned, it will gain a random Type, which changes or adds onto its behavior. This is denoted by the boss bar name as well as particles emitted by the Dragon. Some Dragon Types only appear at lower or higher difficulty levels.

<details>
  <summary>Shared Behavior</summary>
 
The Vanilla Ender Dragon has the following abilities at all times. When there are no more End Crystals left, all Dragon Types will begin to utilize these abilities in addition to their type-specific powers.

- **Summon End Rod Spikes.** These work similarly to Evoker Fangs, and are summoned when the Dragon is perching or preparing to perch, or as a last resort.
- **Ground all players.** This gives all players Levitation 128 for 20 seconds, effectively forcing them to (safely) land if flying with Elytra, and preventing them from taking off right away. If there aren't any flying players, it will try something else instead.
- **Summon Shulker Bullets.** This summons a ring of 12 Shulker Bullets around the Dragon, which will begin to target random players after a few moments. If there are already Shulker Bullets in the area, it will summon End Rod Spikes, instead.

## End Crystals
Whenever an End Crystal is destroyed, it will regenerate. The maximum number of times each End Crystal can regenerate increases the higher the Ender Dragon difficulty, but for the first battle, the maximum is 2. They can also regenerate fewer than the max, but no less than once.

Whenever an End Crystal regenerates, it has a chance to possess at least 1 ability, up to a maximum of 3. At higher difficulties, End Crystals will be guaranteed to have at least 1 ability, and will start with an ability(s) rather than needing to regenerate first. Some abilities will only appear at higher difficulties, too. Most abilities emit particles to denote what they are.

## Rewards
So why would you want to fight such increasingly difficult Ender Dragons? Defeating an Ender Dragon now drops loot near the exit portal, which varies based on the Dragon Type. Additionally, this will always produce 1 custom Dragon-themed item. These items are powerful in their own right, and are more effective when used against Dragons. However, they all have a Curse of Deterioration, which means they all have durability and cannot have the Mending Enchantment applied to them.

If you already have one of the above items, you're less likely to get it again.

There are also advancements for killing each Type and each Difficulty of Dragon.
