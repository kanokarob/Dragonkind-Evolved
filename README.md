# End Battle Reborn
Dragonkind Evolved builds upon the vanilla Ender Dragon fight. Rather than recreate the battle from scratch, it adds additional features and mechanics to increase difficulty and complexity while holding true to the general gameplay loop introduced by Vanilla.

Additionally, it incentivizes and rewards respawning the Ender Dragon. While the initial Ender Dragon fight does include changes, each successive battle will feature new Dragon types and End Crystal mechanics, both of which will continue to scale in difficulty as you slay more and more Ender Dragons.

## Ender Dragons
All Ender Dragons have more health than normal, and will have even more health depending on how many times it has been respawned. This corresponds to its difficulty level (Fledgeling, Powerful, Cruel, Immortal,Ferocious).

Whenever an Ender Dragon is respawned, it will gain a random Type, which changes or adds onto its behavior. This is denoted by the boss bar name as well as particles emitted by the Dragon. Some Dragon Types only appear at lower or higher difficulty levels.

<details>
  <summary>Shared Behavior</summary>
 
The Vanilla Ender Dragon has the following abilities at all times. When there are no more End Crystals left, all Dragon Types will begin to utilize these abilities in addition to their type-specific powers.

- **Summon End Rod Spikes.** These work similarly to Evoker Fangs, and are summoned when the Dragon is perching or preparing to perch, or as a last resort.
- **Ground all players.** This makes all players experience high gravity for 20 seconds, forcing them to (safely) land if flying with Elytra, and preventing them from taking off right away. If there aren't any flying players, it will try something else instead.
- **Summon Shulker Bullets.** This summons a ring of 12 Shulker Bullets around the Dragon, which will begin to target random players after a few moments. If there are already Shulker Bullets in the area, it will summon End Rod Spikes, instead.

## End Crystals
Whenever an End Crystal is destroyed, it will regenerate. The maximum number of times each End Crystal can regenerate increases the higher the Ender Dragon difficulty, but for the first battle, the maximum is 2. They can also regenerate fewer than the max, but no less than once.

Whenever an End Crystal regenerates, it has a chance to possess at least 1 ability, up to a maximum of 3. At higher difficulties, End Crystals will be guaranteed to have at least 1 ability, and will start with an ability(s) rather than needing to regenerate first. Some abilities will only appear at higher difficulties, too. Most abilities emit particles to denote what they are.

Additionally, this will always produce 1 custom Dragon-themed item.

## Ominous Dragon Fights

As of v1.5, when a Dragon is respawned while any of the players in the arena have the Bad Omen effect, they will lose Bad Omen, and an Ominous Dragon Fight will start. This will have effects on the Dragon and End Crystals to make the fight far more challenging, but promises increased rewards.

<details>
  <summary>Ominous Dragon Fight Details</summary>
 
- The difficulty of the fight is increased by 1 tier. This affects the types of Dragon and Crystals that can appear, the Health of the Dragon, and how many times End Crystals can regenerate.
- Regardless of the difficulty tier, the dragon will always be called an "Ominous X Dragon"
- Most Dragons and End Crystals that use periodic abilities will use those abilities more frequently.
- All Dragon Types will use their post-End Crystal abilities throughout the fight, even if there are still End Crystals. These are also used more frequently.
- When defeated, the Dragon will drop the reward amount relative to the increased difficulty tier. Additionally, this loot is doubled, including the unique Dragon Item. (This can result in getting two of the same item.)
